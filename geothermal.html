    <h1 class="geoh"> GEOTHERMAL ENERGY</h1>
    <div class="imgtext">
        <div class="geotext">Geothermal energy is thermal energy extracted from the Earth's crust. It combines energy from the formation of the planet and from radioactive decay. Geothermal energy has been exploited as a source of heat and/or electric power for millennia.

Geothermal heating, using water from hot springs, for example, has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since Roman times. Geothermal power (generation of electricity from geothermal energy), has been used since the 20th century. Geothermal power plants produce power at a constant rate, without regard to weather conditions. Geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity's energy needs. Most extraction occurs in areas near tectonic plate boundaries.Geothermal energy is the heat from beneath the Earth's surface, used to generate clean electricity and for direct heating and cooling. This renewable energy is sourced from the planet's formation and the radioactive decay of elements within the crust, providing a continuous and sustainable heat supply. Hot water or steam is brought to the surface through wells to power turbines for electricity, or it can be used in geothermal heat pumps for temperature regulation in buildings.  </div>

    <h1 class="geothermaladv"> ADVABTAGES OF GEOTHERMAL ENERGY</h1>

    <p>Geothermal energy is a renewable source of continuous production, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.It is a stable energy, as it doen't depend on wind or sun fluctuations. 
    Geothermal installations have a low visual impact and don't generate emissions. In addition, they take up a small amount of land and are compatible with other uses. 

Environment pictogram
It is an indigenous resource that avoids dependence on foreign energy. </p>

<p>Geothermal energy's advantages include its renewable and sustainable nature, low operational costs, and reliable, consistent 24/7 power generation independent of weather conditions. It features a small land footprint compared to other energy sources and offers low carbon emissions, contributing to energy independence and long-term energy security. Additionally, it is versatile, capable of direct heating and cooling applications, and provides long-lasting infrastructure and job creation.  </p>
