    <h1 class="whatdev">Developments in renewable energy</h1>

    <p>Renewable energy development is rapidly expanding globally, driven by cost reductions, environmental concerns, and supportive policies, with solar and wind power leading the charge. Record-breaking additions of renewable capacity occurred in 2024, with Asia, particularly China, dominating new installations. Significant milestones are expected soon, such as renewables overtaking coal in electricity generation by 2025 and solar PV becoming the largest renewable power source by 2029.  Global Trends
Rapid Growth: The global expansion of renewable capacity is accelerating, with renewables accounting for over 90% of total capacity additions in 2024. 
Cost Competitiveness: Renewables, especially solar and wind, have become increasingly cost-effective, often making them the cheapest new-build electricity sources in various regions. 
Dominant Technologies: Solar and wind energy are the primary drivers of this growth, with significant increases in their combined share of global electricity generation. 
Energy Independence: Developing renewable energy is also a key factor in enhancing a country's energy security by reducing dependence on fossil fuels. 
Key Milestones & Projections 
2025: Renewables-based electricity generation is projected to surpass coal-fired generation.
2026: Wind and solar power generation are expected to each surpass nuclear power generation.
2029: Electricity generation from solar PV is set to become the largest renewable power source globally.
2030: Wind-based generation is projected to surpass hydropower.
Regional Developments</p>
<br>
<p>Asia: Holds the majority of new renewable capacity, with China being a major contributor. 
United States: Renewable energy is the fastest-growing energy source, significantly increasing from 2000 to 2020. 
India: Ranks among the top countries for renewable energy capacity and is implementing ambitious plans to increase its non-fossil fuel-based energy capacity by 2030, with strong government policies to attract investment. 
Types of Renewable Energy 
Solar energy: Uses light from the sun (photovoltaic) or its heat (solar thermal).
Wind energy: Harnessed from the wind.
Hydroelectric (or hydraulic) energy: Energy derived from flowing water.
Biomass and Biogas: Energy from organic materials and waste.
Geothermal energy: Heat from beneath the Earth's surface.
Tidal and Wave energy: Energy from ocean tides and waves.
Biofuels: Organic fuels like bioethanol and biodiesel used for transportation.</p>


<h1 class="whatresearch" >Research in renewable energy</h1>
