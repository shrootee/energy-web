               <h1 class="whatrene" style="padding-left: 20px;">What is Renewable Energy?</h1>

    <p>
        Renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished at a faster rate than they are consumed. The fundamental principle involves harnessing flows of energy that occur naturally and continuously in our environment—from the sun, the planet's core, and the moon's gravitational pull.

    <p>Recent studies confirm renewable energy is now the cheapest source of new electricity in most of the world, with growth far exceeding expectations. However, research has shifted to overcoming the major challenge of grid integration, focusing on advanced energy storage like next-generation batteries and green hydrogen for long-term needs. Key innovations include "grid-forming" inverters that stabilize power networks and dual-use systems like agrivoltaics, which combine solar panels with farming to optimize land use. The current focus is on creating a resilient, fully decarbonized energy system through improved grid management and sustainable supply chains.</p>

    <h1 class="what" style="padding-left: 20px;">How much of our primary energy comes from renewables?</h1>

        <p>
We often hear about the rapid growth of renewable technologies in media reports. But how much of an impact has this growth had on our energy systems?

In this interactive chart, we see the share of primary energy consumption that came from renewable technologies – the combination of hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal, wave, tidal, and modern biofuels. Traditional biomass – which can be an important energy source in lower-income settings is not included.

Note that this data is based on primary energy calculated by the 'substitution method' which attempts to correct for the inefficiencies in fossil fuel production. It does this by converting non-fossil fuel sources to their 'input equivalents': the amount of primary energy that would be required to produce the same amount of energy if it came from fossil fuels.

Approximately one-seventh of the world's primary energy is now sourced from renewable technologies.

Note that this is based on renewable energy's share in the energy mix. Energy consumption represents the sum of electricity, transport, and heating. We look at the electricity mix later in this article.</p>
