               <h1 class="whatrene" style="padding-left: 20px;">What is Renewable Energy?</h1>

    <p>
        Renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished at a faster rate than they are consumed. The fundamental principle involves harnessing flows of energy that occur naturally and continuously in our environment—from the sun, the planet's core, and the moon's gravitational pull.
    </p>

    <p>Recent studies confirm renewable energy is now the cheapest source of new electricity in most of the world, with growth far exceeding expectations. However, research has shifted to overcoming the major challenge of grid integration, focusing on advanced energy storage like next-generation batteries and green hydrogen for long-term needs. Key innovations include "grid-forming" inverters that stabilize power networks and dual-use systems like agrivoltaics, which combine solar panels with farming to optimize land use. The current focus is on creating a resilient, fully decarbonized energy system through improved grid management and sustainable supply chains.</p>
        
    <h1 class="generation">Renewable energy generation</h1>
    
    <h1 class="what" style="padding-left: 20px;">How much of our primary energy comes from renewables?</h1>

        <p>
We often hear about the rapid growth of renewable technologies in media reports. But how much of an impact has this growth had on our energy systems?

In this interactive chart, we see the share of primary energy consumption that came from renewable technologies – the combination of hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal, wave, tidal, and modern biofuels. Traditional biomass – which can be an important energy source in lower-income settings is not included.

Note that this data is based on primary energy calculated by the 'substitution method' which attempts to correct for the inefficiencies in fossil fuel production. It does this by converting non-fossil fuel sources to their 'input equivalents': the amount of primary energy that would be required to produce the same amount of energy if it came from fossil fuels.

Approximately one-seventh of the world's primary energy is now sourced from renewable technologies.

Note that this is based on renewable energy's share in the energy mix. Energy consumption represents the sum of electricity, transport, and heating. We look at the electricity mix later in this article.</p>

    <div class="imgtext">
   
    <div class="solartext">Solar energy is the radiant energy from the Sun's light and heat, which can be harnessed using a range of technologies such as solar electricity, solar thermal energy (including solar water heating) and solar architectureIt is an essential source of renewable energy, and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar powerSolar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anticyclones.[9] Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14 °C.[10] By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived</div>

    <h1 class="solartech">Solar Technologies</h1>
    <p>There are three main ways to harness solar energy: photovoltaics, solar heating & cooling, and concentrating solar power.</p>
    

    <h1 class="howused">How solar is used</h1>
    <p>Solar energy can be used for a variety of purposes, including generating electricity, heating water, and powering vehicles. It is a clean and renewable source of energy that can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.</p>
    <p>Solar energy is a very flexible energy technology: it can be built as distributed generation (located at or near the point of use) or as a central-station, utility-scale solar power plant (similar to traditional power plants). Both of these methods can also store the energy they produce for distribution after the sun sets, using cutting-edge solar + storage technologies.</p>

    <div class="imgtext">

    
    <div class="windtext">Wind power is the use of wind energy to generate useful work. Historically, wind power was used by sails, windmills and windpumps, but today it is mostly used to generate electricity. This article deals only with wind power for electricity generation. Today, wind power is generated almost completely using wind turbines, generally grouped into wind farms and connected to the electrical grid.Wind power is considered a sustainable, renewable energy source, and has a much smaller impact on the environment compared to burning fossil fuels. Wind power is variable, so it needs energy storage or other dispatchable generation energy sources to attain a reliable supply of electricity. Land-based (onshore) wind farms have a greater visual impact on the landscape than most other power stations per energy produced.[6][7] Wind farms sited offshore have less visual impact and have higher capacity factors, although they are generally more expensive.[2] Offshore wind power currently has a share of about 10% of new installations.[8]</div>

<h1 class="windadv"> ADVANTAGES OF WIND ENERGY</h1>
    <p> Wind energy is a source of renewable energy. It does not contaminate, it is inexhaustible and reduces the use of fossil fuels, which are the origin of greenhouse gasses that cause global warming.

In addition, wind energy is a “native” energy, because it is available practically everywhere on the plant, which contributes to reducing energy imports and to creating wealth and local employment.</p>


      <P>Wind energy does not emit toxic substances or contaminants into the air, which can be very damaging to the environment and to human beings. Toxic substances can acidify land and water ecosystems, and corrode buildings. Air contaminants can trigger heart disease, cancer and respiratory diseases like asthma.

        <div class="hydrotext">Hydropower (from Ancient Greek ὑδρο-, "water"), also known as water power or water energy, is the use of falling or fast-running water to produce electricity or to power machines. This is achieved by converting the gravitational potential or kinetic energy of a water source to produce power.[1] Hydropower is a method of sustainable energy production. Hydropower is now used principally for hydroelectric power generation, and is also applied as one half of an energy storage system known as pumped-storage hydroelectricity.Hydropower is an attractive alternative to fossil fuels as it does not directly produce carbon dioxide or other atmospheric pollutants and it provides a relatively consistent source of power. Nonetheless, it has economic, sociological, and environmental downsides and requires a sufficiently energetic source of water, such as a river or elevated lake.[2] International institutions such as the World Bank view hydropower as a low-carbon means for economic development</div>

        <h1 class="hydroadv"> ADVANTAGES OF HYDRO ENERGY</h1>

        <p>Electricity can be produced at a constant rate once the dam is constructed

 The gates of the dam can be shut down if electricity is not needed, which stops electricity generation. Hence by doing this, we can save water for further use in future when the demand for electricity is high.
. One of the biggest advantages of hydroelectric power plants is that they are designed to last many decades, and so they can contribute to the generation of electricity for years.

 Large dams often become tourist attractions because the lake that forms in the reservoir area behind the dam can be used for leisure or water sports.

 The water from the lake of the dam can be used for irrigation purposes in farming.<br>

 Since the water is released to produce electricity, the build-up of water in the dam is stored to produce extra energy until needed.

. Hydroelectric energy generation does not pollute the atmosphere because the hydroelectric power plant does not produce greenhouse gases.

. Hydropower plants can be considered a reliable energy generation source. Since hydropower totally depends on water present on this planet, this energy source will remain inexhaustible because of the water cycle as it continuously keeps on maintaining balance on the Earth.</p>

        <div class="geotext">Geothermal energy is thermal energy extracted from the Earth's crust. It combines energy from the formation of the planet and from radioactive decay. Geothermal energy has been exploited as a source of heat and/or electric power for millennia.

Geothermal heating, using water from hot springs, for example, has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since Roman times. Geothermal power (generation of electricity from geothermal energy), has been used since the 20th century. Geothermal power plants produce power at a constant rate, without regard to weather conditions. Geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity's energy needs. Most extraction occurs in areas near tectonic plate boundaries.Geothermal energy is the heat from beneath the Earth's surface, used to generate clean electricity and for direct heating and cooling. This renewable energy is sourced from the planet's formation and the radioactive decay of elements within the crust, providing a continuous and sustainable heat supply. Hot water or steam is brought to the surface through wells to power turbines for electricity, or it can be used in geothermal heat pumps for temperature regulation in buildings.  </div>

<div class="geomasstext">Biomass Power and the Benefits of BiopowerBiomass energy is renewable energy derived from organic materials like plants and animal waste, which are burned or converted into biofuels (bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas) to produce heat, electricity, or transportation fuel. It is considered a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels and can be carbon-neutral, as the carbon released when biomass is used is offset by the carbon absorbed by plants during growth.biomass is matter from recently living (but now dead) organisms which is used for bioenergy production. Examples include wood, wood residues, energy crops, agricultural residues including straw, and organic waste from industry and households.[1] Wood and wood residues is the largest biomass energy source today. Wood can be used as a fuel directly or processed into pellet fuel or other forms of fuels. Other plants can also be used as fuel, for instance maize, switchgrass, miscanthus and bamboo.[2] The main waste feedstocks are wood waste, agricultural waste, municipal solid waste, and manufacturing waste. Upgrading raw biomass to higher grade fuels can be achieved by different methods, broadly classified as thermal, chemical, or biochemical.</div>

    <h1 class="biomassadv" > ADVANTAGES OF BIOMASS ENERGY</h1>

    <p>Biomass energy offers advantages such as being a renewable, abundant, and versatile energy source that can reduce waste by diverting it from landfills. It also helps decrease reliance on fossil fuels and lowers carbon footprints by capturing carbon dioxide during growth, contributing to a more secure and sustainable energy future. Furthermore, biomass energy can stimulate economic growth through job creation in agriculture, collection, and energy generation. It transforms its own waste (for example, through the use of ash as agricultural fertilizer) and minimizes the environmental impact. The availability of raw materials is high and their use contributes to the good use and conservation of natural areas.</p>
