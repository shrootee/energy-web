    <div class="imgtext">
   
    <div class="solartext">Solar energy is the radiant energy from the Sun's light and heat, which can be harnessed using a range of technologies such as solar electricity, solar thermal energy (including solar water heating) and solar architectureIt is an essential source of renewable energy, and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar powerSolar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anticyclones.[9] Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14 °C.[10] By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived</div>

    <h1 class="solartech">Solar Technologies</h1>
    <p>There are three main ways to harness solar energy: photovoltaics, solar heating & cooling, and concentrating solar power.</p>
    

    <h1 class="howused">How solar is used</h1>
    <p>Solar energy can be used for a variety of purposes, including generating electricity, heating water, and powering vehicles. It is a clean and renewable source of energy that can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.</p>
    <p>Solar energy is a very flexible energy technology: it can be built as distributed generation (located at or near the point of use) or as a central-station, utility-scale solar power plant (similar to traditional power plants). Both of these methods can also store the energy they produce for distribution after the sun sets, using cutting-edge solar + storage technologies.</p>
