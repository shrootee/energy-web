    <div class="imgtext">

<div class="geomasstext">Biomass Power and the Benefits of BiopowerBiomass energy is renewable energy derived from organic materials like plants and animal waste, which are burned or converted into biofuels (bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas) to produce heat, electricity, or transportation fuel. It is considered a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels and can be carbon-neutral, as the carbon released when biomass is used is offset by the carbon absorbed by plants during growth.biomass is matter from recently living (but now dead) organisms which is used for bioenergy production. Examples include wood, wood residues, energy crops, agricultural residues including straw, and organic waste from industry and households.[1] Wood and wood residues is the largest biomass energy source today. Wood can be used as a fuel directly or processed into pellet fuel or other forms of fuels. Other plants can also be used as fuel, for instance maize, switchgrass, miscanthus and bamboo.[2] The main waste feedstocks are wood waste, agricultural waste, municipal solid waste, and manufacturing waste. Upgrading raw biomass to higher grade fuels can be achieved by different methods, broadly classified as thermal, chemical, or biochemical.</div>

    <h class="biomassadv" > ADVANTAGES OF BIOMASS ENERGY</h>

    <p>Biomass energy offers advantages such as being a renewable, abundant, and versatile energy source that can reduce waste by diverting it from landfills. It also helps decrease reliance on fossil fuels and lowers carbon footprints by capturing carbon dioxide during growth, contributing to a more secure and sustainable energy future. Furthermore, biomass energy can stimulate economic growth through job creation in agriculture, collection, and energy generation. It transforms its own waste (for example, through the use of ash as agricultural fertilizer) and minimizes the environmental impact. The availability of raw materials is high and their use contributes to the good use and conservation of natural areas.</p>
    <p>It is an asset to combat energy poverty in those parts of the world where the cost of fossil fuels consumes a large part of their GDP.In sectors where decarbonization is very complicated, such as heavy vehicle or air transport.</p>
