    <h1 class="hydroh"> HYDRO ENERGY</h1>
    <div class="imgtext">
        <div class="hydrotext">Hydropower (from Ancient Greek ὑδρο-, "water"), also known as water power or water energy, is the use of falling or fast-running water to produce electricity or to power machines. This is achieved by converting the gravitational potential or kinetic energy of a water source to produce power.[1] Hydropower is a method of sustainable energy production. Hydropower is now used principally for hydroelectric power generation, and is also applied as one half of an energy storage system known as pumped-storage hydroelectricity.Hydropower is an attractive alternative to fossil fuels as it does not directly produce carbon dioxide or other atmospheric pollutants and it provides a relatively consistent source of power. Nonetheless, it has economic, sociological, and environmental downsides and requires a sufficiently energetic source of water, such as a river or elevated lake.[2] International institutions such as the World Bank view hydropower as a low-carbon means for economic development</div>

        <h1 class="hydroadv"> ADVANTAGES OF HYDRO ENERGY</h1>

        <p>Electricity can be produced at a constant rate once the dam is constructed

 The gates of the dam can be shut down if electricity is not needed, which stops electricity generation. Hence by doing this, we can save water for further use in future when the demand for electricity is high.
. One of the biggest advantages of hydroelectric power plants is that they are designed to last many decades, and so they can contribute to the generation of electricity for years.

 Large dams often become tourist attractions because the lake that forms in the reservoir area behind the dam can be used for leisure or water sports.

 The water from the lake of the dam can be used for irrigation purposes in farming.<br>

 Since the water is released to produce electricity, the build-up of water in the dam is stored to produce extra energy until needed.

. Hydroelectric energy generation does not pollute the atmosphere because the hydroelectric power plant does not produce greenhouse gases.

. Hydropower plants can be considered a reliable energy generation source. Since hydropower totally depends on water present on this planet, this energy source will remain inexhaustible because of the water cycle as it continuously keeps on maintaining balance on the Earth.</p>
